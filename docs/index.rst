climax
======

Climax is a little argparse wrapper, with a decorator based syntax heavily
inspired by Armin Ronacher's `click <http://click.pocoo.org/>`_. Climax can
import native argparse parsers as sub-commands, and can also export itself as
a native parser, providing full interoperability with existing argparse
based solutions.
